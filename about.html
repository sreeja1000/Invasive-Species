    <h1>About This Project</h1>

    <div class = "about">
      <div class = first>
        <p class = "img-text">This project is dedicated to protecting our environment by addressing the threat of Emerald Ash Borers (EAB), an invasive beetle species devastating ash tree populations across North America. At the Bulk Farm, EAB infestation had taken hold, endangering the local ecosystem. To help stop the spread, Sreeja led an initiative to remove 50 infested ash trees and replace them with resilient native oak trees, promoting a healthier and more sustainable environment for the future.</p>

        <p class = "img-text">This website was created to share the purpose and progress of the project, and to raise awareness about both invasive species, like the emerald ash borer, and native species present at the farm. By learning more, visitors can understand the importance of ecological balance and the value of native biodiversity.
