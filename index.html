    <h3>About the Project</h3>
    <p>Invasive species such as the Emerald Ash Borer cause serious harm to native species. Ash trees, which are native to New Jersey, are dying because of Emerald Ash Borers. To prevent further spread of these bugs, we can work together to replant the Ash trees. We will be taking away the habitats and food source of Emerald Ash Borers, killing them. Then replacing them with oak trees, native to New Jersey.</p>
